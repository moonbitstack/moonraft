# raft-moonbit

Raft consensus algorithm implemented in MoonBit.

Raft keeps a cluster of nodes agreeing on the order of a command log even when some nodes crash or the network drops, delays and reorders messages. It is the foundation of the replicated state machines used by systems such as etcd, TiKV and Consul. This is an independent MoonBit implementation whose engineering structure references the Go [etcd-io/raft](https://github.com/etcd-io/raft).

It ships two ways to run the protocol on top of one consensus core:

- a **synchronous driver** (`run_election`, `replicate`) that composes the RPC handlers into whole rounds — small and easy to read or embed; and
- a **message-driven server** (`RaftNode`) that talks only in `Message`s through `tick` and `step`, so a real transport — or the bundled deterministic simulator — can drive it exactly the way etcd separates protocol logic from I/O.

## Live demo — Raft, running in your browser

**▶ https://lfan-ke.github.io/raft-moonbit/**

The consensus core and the deterministic `Cluster` simulator are compiled to JavaScript with `moon build --target js` and run entirely in the page — no server, no mock. Drive leader elections, replicate a log, split the network into a brain-split, crash and restart nodes, add packet loss — and watch Raft's safety invariants (**Election Safety**, **State-Machine Safety**, command agreement) hold through all of it while the logs reconcile on heal.

![Raft consensus demo: a network partition with two leaders in different terms — the hard safety invariants still hold](docs/demo-screenshot.png)

The visualization is not a JavaScript re-implementation: it calls straight into the MoonBit code every tick, and everything on screen comes from `demo_state()`, the JSON snapshot the simulator returns. The browser bridge is `demo_driver.mbt`; the front end lives under [`docs/`](docs/).

### Build and run the demo locally

```
moon build --target js --release                 # -> _build/js/release/build/raft-moonbit.js
cp _build/js/release/build/raft-moonbit.js docs/raft-moonbit.js
python3 -m http.server 8099 --directory docs     # then open http://localhost:8099/
```

An ES-module import needs `http(s)`; opening `index.html` as a `file://` URL will not work.

## Features

- **Leader election** with the Follower / Candidate / Leader roles and the up-to-date-log voting restriction (§5.2, §5.4.1).
- **Pre-vote** so a partitioned node cannot inflate the cluster term, plus randomized election timeouts and heartbeats off a per-node deterministic PRNG.
- **Log replication** through AppendEntries: the log-matching check, conflicting-suffix truncation, and majority commit within the current term (§5.3, §5.4.2). Replies carry a `conflict_index` hint for one-jump backoff, and per-follower `Progress` (probe / replicate / snapshot) drives repair — including from heartbeat acks.
- **Snapshots and log compaction** (§7): `compact`, the `InstallSnapshot` RPC, and automatic snapshot fallback for a follower whose next entry has already been compacted away.
- **Membership changes** (§6): single-server add/remove and full **joint consensus** (a C(old,new) transition needing a majority of both halves), carried as `ConfChange` log entries and folded in by a configuration state machine.
- **Persistence and crash recovery** (§5.3): a `HardState`, an append-only write-ahead log (`WalStore`) with replay, and an etcd-style `MemoryStorage` engine with index/term/slice reads, conflict-truncating append, compaction and snapshotting — plus a storage-backed recovery path.
- **Linearizable reads** via ReadIndex / leader lease, and **check-quorum** so a leader that loses contact with a majority steps down.
- **Leadership transfer** (`TimeoutNow`, §3.10) for an orderly handover to a caught-up follower.
- **Pluggable `StateMachine`, `Transport`, `LogStore` and `RaftStorage`** traits, with a replicated key-value store as the worked example.
- **Deterministic simulation harness** (`Cluster`): a single-seed, discrete-time network that drops, delays, reorders, partitions and crashes/restarts nodes, with built-in safety-invariant checks (one leader per term, an agreeing committed prefix, log matching) and a suite of scenario and chaos tests.

## Install

```
moon add heke1228/raft-moonbit
```

## Example

```moonbit
// Drive a five-node cluster through the deterministic simulator.
let cluster = @raft.Cluster::new(["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"], seed=1)
let leader = cluster.run_until_leader(200)          // elect a leader
let _ = cluster.propose(b"set x = 1")               // replicate a command
let _ = cluster.run_until_committed(2, 200)         // wait for commit

// Inject a fault and watch the cluster keep its safety guarantees.
cluster.crash(leader.unwrap())
let _ = cluster.run_until_leader(400)               // a new leader takes over
assert_true(cluster.one_leader_per_term())
assert_true(cluster.committed_agrees())
```

The lower-level `Node` and `RaftNode` APIs are used directly in the tests; see `raftnode_wbtest.mbt` for the message-driven path and `cluster_wbtest.mbt` for the synchronous one.
